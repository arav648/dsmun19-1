Greetings to one and all, and welcome to the United Nations Social
Convention on Religion and Terror.

Before getting into the formalities, I’d like to introduce myself a little better.
I’m in the 12th grade, I study humanities and have a keen interest in MUN,
especially DSMUN. apart other MUN’s, DSMUN has always been very close
to me and to be chairing a committee is truly a privilege. Dramatics has
always been an integral part of my life in school ever since my first
founder’s production. As far as sports go, I play both football and hockey
further I follow football religiously, I am a huge Manchester United fan. I
am an avid reader and an aspiring lawyer, I’m open to a conversation on
any topic ranging from politics to sports outside the committee.

When I first got to know that I had been appointed chairperson of this
committee, I sat with my deputy chairpersons and we discussed what to
make of this committee, and frankly, it was an outpour of ideas which were,
after much debate and discussion, put to paper. After coming to a final
decision, our confluence of these ideas materialized into the committee that
stands before us today. In the twenty first century theocracies around the
world have been accused of being conventional as well as not being able to
keep up with times.

Our committee dwells on the “Reformation of Theocracies ” and will be a
treat for all delegates, who are prepared, of course; the idea behind this
agenda is not to destroy but rather help the in the transition of these
theocracies.

All in all, I’m hoping that the committee will be a delightful and enjoyable
learning experience for one and all. Hoping to see all of you at Chandbagh
very soon! Best of luck!
